In this project, we have explored the use of interpolation and integration methods, specifically cubic splines and several numerical integration techniques. The results obtained from these methods have proven to be visually significant and numerically reliable.

The use of cubic splines has allowed us to interpolate a series of points representing an airfoild, resulting in a continuous function passing through all the points.

Regarding the integration methods, we have implemented and tested five different techniques to measure the length of plane curves defined by an integral. Each method was evaluated in terms of speed and convergence, and the results obtained have been found to be reliable.

Overall, these methods have proven to be useful in the numerical analysis of functions and curves. They allow us to accurately interpolate and integrate a series of points, leading to a trustworthy pressure map.
