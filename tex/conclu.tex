In this project, interpolation and integration methods were explored, specifically cubic splines and several numerical integration techniques. The results obtained from these methods were proven to be visually significant and numerically reliable.

The use of cubic splines allowed the interpolation of a series of points representing an airfoild, resulting in a continuous function passing through all the points.

Regarding the integration methods, five different techniques were implemented and tested, so the length of plane curves was measured. Each method was evaluated in terms of speed and convergence. The results obtained were found to be reliable.

Overall, these methods were proven to be useful in the numerical analysis of functions and curves. They allowed the accurate interpolation and integration of a series of points, leading to a trustworthy pressure map.
